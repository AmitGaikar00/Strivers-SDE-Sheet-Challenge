 # Repeat and Missing Number Array #

You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.
Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.
Return A and B.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Note that in your output A should precede B.

Example:
<br/>
Input:[3 1 2 5 3] 
<br/>
Output:[3, 4] 
<br/>
A = 3, B = 4
